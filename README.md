Hi there 👋,

My name is Matthias and I am an Austrian HTL student.
I currently am learning Python and Flutter besides my HTL informatics curriculum.
I use tools like PyCharm, IntelliJ, Apple Notes, but I'm also starting to use Figma and IcePanel.

You can currently reach me under @mattidj_ on socials.
